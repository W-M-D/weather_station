# weather_station

The ultimate in nrf52832 based APRS weather stations! 

Just a quick update after finding that you can buy a weather station replacement kit for ~$70 that has a few radios that is already supported by rtl_433 i sat down and did some thinking. What could i do that would be more universal. Like the ultimate Ham hacking kit. After much debate with myself. I have decided to make something much more generic.  But i also wanted to create something that was much more than a simple dev board. I'm keeping the universality down to one radio besides the Bluetooth one. But i am going to add a raspberry pi header for reasons. My goal is to make a device that, with your ham radio, you can create anything you desire within the limits of the community and APRS.
